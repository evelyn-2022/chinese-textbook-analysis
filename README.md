# Chinese Textbook Analysis

## What is this project used for

This form can be used by teachers and educators to analyse and choose suitable Chinese textbooks by grading a book from various aspects. It will automatically generate an analysis report, so users don't need to calculate the final scores manually.

## Why I built this project

Since I'm currently doing a master's degree in Teaching Chinese as an International Language, this project is actualy built for one of my course assignments. I'm so happy to be able to implement my newly acquired React knowledge into practice.

## Continued development

I tried to add highlight to navbar when scrolling but failed. After googling for a whole day, I am able to implement the feature in a single component, but have no idea how to pass all those data and refs among different components. Maybe I'll be able to finish it after learning `uesContext` and router.
